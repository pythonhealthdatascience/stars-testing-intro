# STARS: Testing in Research Workflows

This repository contains the code behind the website on **Testing in Research Workflows**, developed as part of the <a href='https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars/' target='_blank'>STARS project</a>. (Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulation). The materials help researchers integrate testing practices into their workflows, with guidance on testing in Python and R.

These resources are used in HDR UK's RSE001 <a href='https://hdruklearn.org/courses/course-v1:HDRUK+RSE001+2024' target ='_blank'>Research Software Engineering training course</a> ('Testing in Research Workflows' module), but are also intended as a reusable, open educational resource for the wider research software community.
